/**
 * PaymentInitiationConsentPaymentExecuteRequest defines the request schema for `/payment_initiation/consent/payment/execute`
 *
 * @param consentId The consent ID.
 * @param amount
 * @param idempotencyKey A random key provided by the client, per unique consent payment. Maximum of 128 characters.  The API supports idempotency for safely retrying requests without accidentally performing the same operation twice. If a request to execute a consent payment fails due to a network connection error, you can retry the request with the same idempotency key to guarantee that only a single payment is created. If the request was successfully processed, it will prevent any payment that uses the same idempotency key, and was received within 24 hours of the first request, from being processed.
 * @param clientId Your Plaid API `client_id`. The `client_id` is required and may be provided either in the `PLAID-CLIENT-ID` header or as part of a request body.
 * @param secret Your Plaid API `secret`. The `secret` is required and may be provided either in the `PLAID-SECRET` header or as part of a request body.
